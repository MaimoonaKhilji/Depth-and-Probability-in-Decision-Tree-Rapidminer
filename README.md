# Depth-and-Probability-in-Decision-Tree-Rapidminer

Dataset: Titanic
* Q1. Can you find out how to restrict the depth of the decision tree, i.e.reduce its complexity? Why could this be a good idea?
* Q2. What would you say was the rough probability for survival for this group? How does this compare to the survival probability for men?
